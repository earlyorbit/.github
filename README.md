**EARLY ACCESS!! Take a sneak peak at our latest release, [Decker.app](https://decker.app) — a big picture pro-app view of your first thousand ideas. Built for the future of AI agents and ultra-mobile AR/VR displays!**

Early Orbit is a startup studio with a broad mandate to dream up and launch massively valuable apps and businesses that unleash human super-intelligence through modern knowledge tools.

Most of the work we do as humans can be considered knowledge work, but the tools we have for such work is still stuck in the stone age. We believe there's huge potential for modern digital tools that better fit our human nature, that better optimize for human instead of computer effectiveness, that enable us to consolidate and regain control of our digital life — super-charging knowledge workers through a frictionless, joyful experience.

Early Orbit's core team consist of [Bjørn Stabell](www.linkedin.com/in/beorn) and [Michael Welch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwelch/), who together founded the startup studio Exoweb Labs, where they dreamt up and launched the mobile gaming company Happylatte ($8.5M raised from Index Ventures) whose games reached top download and grossing spots and app store market intelligence leader, App Annie/Data.ai ($157M raised from IDG, Sequoia, IVP, Greycroft, Infinity).
